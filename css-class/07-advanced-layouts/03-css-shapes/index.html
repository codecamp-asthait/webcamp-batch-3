        <h1>CSS Shapes</h1>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Circle Shape</h2>
            <div class="demo-area">
                <div class="shape circle-shape"></div>
                <p>Text wraps around the circular shape on the left. This demonstrates how CSS shapes allow text to flow around non-rectangular elements, creating more interesting layouts similar to what you'd find in magazine or newspaper designs.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Ellipse Shape</h2>
            <div class="demo-area">
                <div class="shape ellipse-shape"></div>
                <p>This example uses an ellipse shape. The text flows around the elongated elliptical form. CSS shapes provide a powerful way to create unique layouts that go beyond traditional rectangular boxes, allowing for more creative and engaging designs.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Polygon Shape</h2>
            <div class="demo-area">
                <div class="shape polygon-shape"></div>
                <p>This demonstrates a polygon shape created with multiple points. Text wraps around the triangular polygon, showing the flexibility of CSS shapes in creating complex custom shapes for content wrapping.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Inset Shape with Margin</h2>
            <div class="demo-area">
                <div class="shape inset-shape"></div>
                <p>The inset shape with rounded corners demonstrates how to create complex shapes with margin control. This creates spacing between the content and the shape boundary, allowing for more refined content flow.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Multiple Shapes</h2>
            <div class="complex-demo">
                <div class="shape circle-shape"></div>
                <p>Multiple shapes can be combined to create intricate layouts. This section shows how shapes work together to guide content flow through custom paths and boundaries, creating visually interesting page designs.</p>
