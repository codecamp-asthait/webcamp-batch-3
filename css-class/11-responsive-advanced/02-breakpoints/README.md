# Understanding Breakpoints

## What are Breakpoints?
Breakpoints are specific screen widths where your design adapts and changes. They define the thresholds at which your layout, typography, or other styles should adjust to provide optimal viewing experience.

## Common Standard Breakpoints
- Extra Small (XS): 0px - 479px (phones)
- Small (SM): 480px - 767px (large phones, small tablets)
- Medium (MD): 768px - 1023px (tablets)
- Large (LG): 1024px - 1279px (small desktops)
- Extra Large (XL): 1280px+ (large desktops)
- XXL: 1400px+ (very large screens)

## Setting Breakpoints
Start with mobile-first approach and use min-width media queries to progressively enhance your design for larger screens.

## Best Practices
1. Use analytics to understand your audience's devices
2. Keep 3-5 main breakpoints maximum
3. Test on real devices, not just browser resize
4. Use consistent naming across projects
5. Document your breakpoint strategy
6. Organize CSS by breakpoint logically
