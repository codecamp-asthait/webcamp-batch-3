# Mobile-First Design

## Overview
Mobile-first design is a strategy where you design for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance the experience for larger screens using media queries.

## Key Concepts

### What is Mobile-First?
- Start with styles for the smallest screens
- Add complexity and features for larger screens
- Results in cleaner, more maintainable code
- Better performance on mobile devices

### Benefits
1. Performance: Mobile users get minimal CSS first
2. Simplicity: Forces you to prioritize content
3. Accessibility: Better semantic structure
4. Maintainability: Easier to scale up than down

## Common Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 479px
- Tablet: 480px - 767px
- Desktop: 768px+

## Best Practices
1. Always start with mobile viewport
2. Use min-width media queries
3. Organize CSS by breakpoint
4. Test on actual mobile devices
5. Use relative units (em, rem)
